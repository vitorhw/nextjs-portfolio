my portfolio is my personal space where I showcase my latest projects and express myself. As a designer and developer, I've combined both worlds and created this piece of art, powered by NextJS, Contentlayer and Upstash!

## Features

- **Views:** view counter for each project, facilitate by Redis through Upstash
- **NextJS 13:** powered with the new apps directory and server components
- **Markdown:** quick iteration and project addition with the convenience of repurposing the README file.
